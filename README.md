A floating widget to remotely operate GoPro cameras

Always-on-top widget to control GoPro cameras. You can be sure of the camera's status even if you don't see the camera and start the recording in a snap, even if the camera is attached out of reach. As a result, you can more easily capture those epic stunts (or epic fails!).

Starting and stopping of recording is notified with audio - this will improve your concentration on more important things, e.g., riding or driving. The application listens to the intent "akson.RECORD" (you can try this with for example the Button Mapper application), so you can also control the recording with a Bluetooth remote (e.g., Silver Fox).

The application requires permissions to be displayed on top of other applications and seek nearby devices. The widget can be moved around from the data area and the round button starts and stops the recording. A long press opens the settings.

Tested solely on GoPro Hero 7 Black, but this should work also with newer and some older models.
